# Intro-to-AI-Final-Project-The-Humanoid
Implementation of Reinforcement learning for training a humanoid to successfully walk forward.

This project uses reinforcement learning to train a humanoid agent to walk forward. It’s basically a computer-modeling approach to human locomotion, especially gait. This environment is particularly interesting in the human research world as it’s an example of AI being used to mirror how humans learn movement. In this project a trial-and-error approach using reinforcement learning somewhat replicates how children, and even adults recovering from neurological or orthopedic injuries, have to relearn optimal gait and walking mechanics.

I’m using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns through repeated attempts, feedback, and adjustment. The files for this project include:
•	A Jupyter Notebook Python file with the agent setup, the reinforcement learning model, plotting and performance visualizations, and code for saving video outputs
•	A PDF export of the notebook showing the full 1.5 million timestep run and its results (the other attempts only differ by the number of time steps)
•	A written report that with a project overview, approach, results, interpretation, and conclusion
•	A file with YouTube links showing four example humanoid runs at different training durations
